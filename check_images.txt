Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

Answer: Yes, all the model architectures classified it correctly. I uploaded an image of a German Shepherd in Dog_01.jpg and all three models correctly classified it as German Shepherd.


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Yes. I uploaded a mirror image(horizontally flipped) of the German Shepherd for Dog_02.jpg and all three models classified it the same as Dog_01.jpg.


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: Yes. I uploaded a Cat's image for Animal_Name_01.jpg and all three models classified it as a cat. And also, I uploaded a Joystick image for the Object_Name_01.jpg and all three classified it as a joystick.


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: I choose vgg AND resnet. The reason I can't separate these two is because they both classified the 4 uploaded images exactly the same. I discarded alexnet completely because, on the cat classification, it classified the cat as 'egyptian cat, cat'. But the image I uploaded was not an image of an Egyptian cat. But, resnet and vgg classified the cat image as 'tiger cat, cat' which was somewhat closer to the image uploaded than that of alexnet's classification.
